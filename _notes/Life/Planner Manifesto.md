My Planner Manifesto?

### The Filofax Years

During my time in university, I started to feel suffocated by the pre-populated weekly template of the official academic planner that was given to me every year. This was when I started exploring more options for planning. After some research online, I found myself admiring ring-binder planners. The way you could organize the papers any way you wanted, or add in your own pages had my mind spinning with planning inspiration. I bought a cheap version of one of these binders to use for a couple months and I loved it. But of course, I had my eye on the prize, the true king of the ring-binder space, Filofax.

Sometime during my 3rd year of university, I finally pulled the trigger and bought it. I had a genuine [personal-sized purple Filofax Malden](https://ca.filofax.com/collections/malden/products/malden-personal-organizer-filofax), a common sight in the 90s I'm sure, but this was like 2014. I'm pretty sure I even had some professors comment on it. I loved the thing. I would print and cut personalized pages for it and swap out stickers and sticky notes in the pocket on a weekly basis. 

I'd say I used this system for about a year and a half until I felt it was getting too bulky and heavy for me. Thankfully the planning community was there for me again with the next trend...

### Bullet Journaling and It's Legacy

[Bullet Journaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM) for anyone who may not be familiar with it is a simplified system of planning that allows you to use a regular blank notebook as your planner. Shockingly, despite it being so simple, it's quite hard to find a simple explanation of what bullet journaling is anymore. This is partially because the creator has decided to milk their idea as much as possible in the form of a $250 course, a 320 page book, and a $40 customized notebook.

I loved bullet journaling because it was cheap, easy, and works very well. I loved how I could use my notebook for multiple things. I could doodle on one page, write about a stress-induced breakdown on another, and flip a page, label it "Tuesday, November 24th" and go back to planning. The free-form feel of it was great. The catch? So many bullet journals online are absolutely beautiful. People would take the time to delicately washi tape their weekly spreads. One person in particular made beautiful hand painted water coloured monthly themes for their journal. And here was my scribbly journal, usually written with the first pen I could find in my bag. Sometimes I put a sticker down, but nothing so pretty as what I saw online. I considered myself a creative person and it was so hard not to compare myself to them. It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that I was a university student and the practicality of the planner needs to come before the aesthetics.

Bullet Journaling has by-far been my rock. It's my stable go-to that I can always rely on to Get. Things. Done. It's just... boring if you don't put the time into making it pretty. And I don't have the time nor the skill for that.

This is where I briefly leave the planning community for the world of tech. For I am about to graduate university as a computer engineer and I want to feel sophisticated, modern, productive. Productivity was the key word here. I fell down the deep dark productivity rabbit hole.

### Todo Lists & Todoist

Planning at its simpliest is a list, right? That's where Todoist enters my planning journey.

Where did I go wrong here? Well, this was when I started living away from roommates and on my own, and I wanted a way to keep track of my chores. I had created a project in Todoist that listed all my chores at varying frequencies. Everything from garbage day to cleaning the fridge and stove every few months. Maybe you're the kind of person to think "Wow what a great idea!" when you hear that, or maybe it's more "This person is a psychopath". Well after going through this, I think am more of the latter kind of person now.

You cannot assume you are going to stick to a rigid chore schedule. On top of day-to-day tasks, I was so overwhelmed by 8-9 item to-do lists every day. Sometimes they'd snowball because I couldn't get it all done. What was the most frustrating about Todoist in particular was that I couldn't see what I accomplished at the end of the day, only what I didn't. I could have ticked off 10 things that day and all I could see in the app that evening was the 5 things I didn't, or what was next.

Eventually I dropped Todoist for a different tech tool that was starting to gain popularity.

### Notion

Notion is this fun tool where the planning community meets the tech community. I don't even know how to describe Notion. It is this beautiful beast of a documentation and collaboration tool. Where it really shines in my opinion is its support of linked databases.
