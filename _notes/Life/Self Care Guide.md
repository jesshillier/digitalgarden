# Self Care Guide

## Sleep
- practice good sleep habits
- Sleep and wake up at the same time every day (even weekends!)
- Limit screen use 30min before bedtime
- Use a night routine (skincare and brush teeth ) as cues to signal the body for sleep 

## Skincare

### Face
#### AM
* Rinse
* Apply vitamin C serum
* Apply AM moisturizer (with SPF!)

### PM
* Wash off makeup
* Use gentle cleanser to wash face
* 2x week exfoliate
* Apply PM moisturizer
* 2-3x a week use a retinoid
* As a treat, face mask

### Body
* Use scrub mitt to exfoliate and scrub body clean.
* Shower every day (ofc)
* A hot bath can be mentally and physically refreshing, especially with some good products (epsom salt, bath bombs, sugar scrub)

### Hands & Feet
* Am I protecting my hands from hot water/cleaning solutions?
* Am I moisturing my hands and cuticles?
* Can use moisturizers and exfoliating tools to keep feet soft and smooth.
* When it becomes too much to manage on your own, a mani/pedi can always get you back on track

## Hair
- wash hair twice a week
- Use a high quality hair towel to dry hair and prevent frizz early. 
- self massage using coconut oil before a wash is great for the scalp (and possibly promotes hair growth?)
- Once a week use deep conditioning mask to keep hair soft.
- Avoid products with alcohol - they destroy curly hair
- Use a silk pillowcase or silk bonnet (maybe both?) to prevent frizz from forming while sleeping.

## Nutrition and Hydration
* Try to drink at least 2L of water per day, 3L if exercising. Black coffee/tea counts.
* Am I eating well? Are my meals relatively healthy and well portioned?
* Am I snacking a lot? Are said snacks sugary? What value do they give me?
* Aim for 80:20 ratio of valuable foods to treats.
* Maybe track food for a few weeks to reset, especially after holidays

## Fitness
* Try to get 30min of movement in per day.
* Favourite exercises:
    * Hiking
    * Walk around the neighborhood
    * Cycling
    * Strength training
    * Yoga ðŸ’œðŸ’œ
    * Deep cleaning!
