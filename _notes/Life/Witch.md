Growing up in Rural Nova Scotia, I came to have an intense love for the natural world. Since there wasn't much else to do near our home, I would often go out and explore the woods around the property and I'd find my own place to just be.

As was popular with teenage girls around that time, I fell into a bit of a Wicca phase. I grew up fairly non-religious, and I was actually uncomfortable with the idea of God and Christianity as a teen. Wicca spoke to me because much of its core was formed from nature-based pagan traditions of celebrating the changing of the seasons. And of course, as a nerdy girl who read a lot of YA fiction, who wouldn't be drawn in by the magick (with a k, that k was important) and spells?

My parents didn't mind at all. I remember I brought a tarot deck home and my mom told me my only rules were "don't summon demons" and "don't tell your grandmother, she'd have a fit". She had nothing to worry about as all I really ended up doing was some sort of release "spell" when I broke up with my first boyfriend (basically I wrote a letter of my feelings and burned it).

I stopped calling myself Wiccan as I got to university, it started to feel kind of cringey and to be honest I couldn't get myself to believe any of the supernatural or occult parts of Wicca. That being said, some of those practices still speak to me. I still privately observe the 8 "Wheel of the Year" holidays and try to mark them by doing something, usually baking something seasonal and going for a mindful walk/hike. While tarot cards can't tell the future, they are a great tool for self-reflection and journaling. And tracking the phases of the moon also helps me feel more connected to the rhythms of our world.

Sometimes it is fun to dress up those personal traditions with candles and ambient music and feel "witchy" about them. I still love the witchy aesthetic and its fun to research and play around in that space. But at its core, I feel my interest is mostly about exploring myself and my identity, and deeping my own appreciation of the outside world and isn't based in any supernatural belief. 

Last year, I came across the term SASS (Skeptical, Agnostic/Atheist, Science-Seeking) Witch. They are generally skeptical, do not believe in the supernatural, and are very interested in science. I've found a lot of like minded individuals by using this term. If I ever decide to label what I have created for myself, I suppose it would be something along those lines.
