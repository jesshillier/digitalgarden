# Imagine You Are An Octopus

I found [this BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220720-do-octopuses-feel-pain) linked on HackerNews about 2 weeks ago and something about it inspired me.

While the article's main points discussed the ethics of octopus farming and the conciousness of animals, I found the most interesting part to be about imagining being an octopus.

> The closer you look at the octopus's body and nervous system, the harder it becomes to grasp – or believe you are grasping – what it might be like to be an octopus. After all, the last common ancestor we shared with octopuses lived 600 million years ago (an uninspiring-looking animal something like a flatworm).

Octopods are just so alient to our own bodies and their existance so different, we can't even begin to really grasp what it might be like to be an octopus.

This thought is what initially got me thinking about a game/experience surrounding animal conciousness.
