Using the hydroponics set that Colten's mom gave us, we have been having a lot of fun experimenting with growing herbs.

Herbs We Have Grown So Far With Some Notes: 

### Basil

* Grown both hydroponically and in soil
* Easy to grow from seed, not too difficult to take care of
* As it matured, the main stem started to grow thicker and bark like
* It also started flowering, we pinched the flowers off to keep it growing
* Love love loved having basil around, we often used it

### Chive

* Grown in soil
* Not necessarily hard to take care of, but does need water fairly often
* As it got older, a lot of dried out white grasses appeared. Not sure if it's age or inconsistent watering
* Was nice to have around the house but we often forgot to use it 

### Dill

* Grown both hydroponically and in soil
* Dill grows so fast, and we don't know what to do with it all.
* I don't really smell that classic dill scent until we harvest it.
* Because of the sheer amount of dill we had to harvest, we made a lot of [Dill Rolls](https://monasterykitchen.org/savory-dill-rolls/)

### Lavendar

### Mint

* Mint has been hard to get started from seed. Have had more luck sprouting in soil but not always successful
* Love having it around but we don't often use it. I liked it for fresh mint tea sometimes.

### Oregano
### Parsley
### Rosemary
### Thyme
