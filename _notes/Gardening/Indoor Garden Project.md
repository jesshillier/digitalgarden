While on YouTube shorts, I came across [Gardening Indoors](https://www.youtube.com/@gardeningindoors) who had a very cool setup for her indoor garden, and it gave me an idea for a fun project.

1. Buy a second hand hutch with at least a glass door for some natural lighting on Facebook marketplace.
2. Add LED lights to the bottom of each shelf (should look up what might be necesary for plants to grow)
3. Plants can now be placed in it, kept away from curious cats, and well lit for better growth

I think this would work really well for our indoor [[Herb Gardening]] project and wouldn't be as much of an eye-sore as the giant pile of plants we currently have on a table.
