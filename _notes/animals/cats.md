I've grown up around cats my whole life. My mom is a huge animal lover and I've definitely inherieted that same love for the creatures we share our planet with.

Cats, despite their popular image are actually very social animals. If you know how to communicate with them, you can build a strong, if maybe needy bond with them. 

That being said, I don't recommend speaking back to them when they meow as kittens.. I did it because I thought it was cute to have a "conversation" with them. Now mine are very vocal and while it's entertaining to guests, it's not so entertaining at 2am when they're screaming expecting playtime.
